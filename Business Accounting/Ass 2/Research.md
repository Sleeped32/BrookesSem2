**Survey:**

### Improvement To Staff Productivity

Evidence and data. Interviewees said deploying Business Central allowed their organizations’ finance and operations staff to reduce the amount of time they spent on manual reporting and information reconciliation while also providing improved visibility and tools to accelerate and improve the quality of decision-making. Automating tasks within these finance and operations processes yielded quantifiable productivity savings for the organizations’ staff. As a result, as the organizations continued to grow, they required fewer finance and operations hires because of the capacity increase due to more efficient staff. Having a modern, intuitive user experience further improved productivity, which reduced the requirement for training or re-training for new and existing staff. Ultimately, migrating to Business Central in the cloud enabled finance and operations staff to operate more effectively while offsetting subsequent hires required as the organizations grew, which yielded savings quantified in user productivity.

- The interviewee at the manufacturing organization spoke to efficiencies for finance staff resulting from the Dynamics 365 Business Central migration — notably, integration with online document signatures, real-time reporting and integration with CRM, online customer payments, and faster internal reimbursements.
- A finance manager in the food and beverage importing industry said that after migrating to Dynamics 365 Business Central, their organization was able to consolidate several business units under one ERP system, which improved the productivity of supply-chain personnel by reducing the need to consolidate information across several business units operating on Microsoft Dynamics on-premises ERP solutions.

Dynamics 365 Business Central can revolutionise how you do business, taking streamlining, automation and customer engagement to a new level. It gives you a single, end-to end solution for managing finances, operations, sales and customer service, and an opportunity to easily upgrade from entry-level accounting software and legacy ERP systems.

Dynamics 365 Business Central is great value because it integrates with other Microsoft cloud services including Office 365 and can be customised or extended for specific industry needs with Power Apps, Power Automate and Power BI.

### Pros

- **Integrated Solutions:** Dynamics 365 Business Central integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products like Outlook, Excel, and Teams, enhancing productivity by connecting various business functions.
- **Customization:** It offers extensive customization options through add-ons and Power Apps, allowing businesses to tailor the software to their unique needs.
- **User Experience:** The platform is known for its user-friendly interface, making it easier for team members to navigate and adapt, which improves overall efficiency.

### Cons

- **Complex Setup:** Setting up the software can be complex, especially for businesses without a dedicated IT team.
- **Cost for SMBS:** The pricing model can be challenging for smaller businesses, potentially affecting its affordability and accessibility.
- **Limited Scalability:** While effective for small to medium-sized businesses, it might not scale as efficiently for larger enterprises or those with more complex needs.

### Expert Opinion

Judging from its features, integrations, and user interface, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central stands out as a competent ERP solution. It excels in providing a comprehensive, user-friendly experience but can fall short in scalability and ease of initial setup. I find it most suitable for businesses that already rely on other Microsoft products and need a reliable ERP system to unify their operations.

[TallyPrime](https://tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/) is a comprehensive ERP software solution that manages accounting, inventory, statutory compliance, and other critical business processes. It primarily serves small to medium-sized enterprises seeking value for money in managing purchase orders and financial operations.

This software solution offers benefits like automation in financial reporting, tax management, and ensuring data integrity, which is crucial for accurate balance sheets.

TallyPrime tackles common hassles such as complex tax filing, including e-way bill generation, fragmented data management, and cumbersome statutory compliance processes. Among its best features are its user-friendly interface, robust tax filing capabilities, including e-way bill integration, and flexible reporting to streamline workflow.

## Pros

- **User Experience:** Simplified navigation and intuitive shortcuts allow users, even on a single-user basis, to find functions quickly, enhancing productivity.
- **Tax Compliance:** Automation in tax management, including e-way bill processes, ensures businesses maintain statutory compliance with minimal effort.
- **Data Integrity:** Secure data processing maintains accuracy and reliability across business processes, ensuring receivables and payables are always in check.

## Cons

- **Customization Limits:** Limited personalization options may not fully cater to businesses with unique order processing workflows.
- **Scalability Concerns:** Larger companies may find TallyPrime less scalable compared to other accounting software designed for greater company size.
- **Support Variability:** The quality of customer support can vary, which may introduce a hassle in resolving complex issues for multi-user environments.

## Expert Opinion

In my professional view, TallyPrime offers a solid choice for small to medium-sized businesses in need of robust accounting and tax management tools. While its interface is notably user-friendly, easing the onboarding process, it may lack the depth of customization that larger enterprises require. It excels in providing a reliable environment for financial management and compliance, often compared favourably in user reviews to Tally ERP 9 for its focus on core features.

TallyPrime is particularly well-suited for businesses that prioritize financial process integrity and straightforward tax handling over expansive customization and scalability.

## TallyPrime: The Bottom Line

What sets TallyPrime apart, often cited in the best accounting software lists is its commitment to simplifying complex financial tasks through a user-friendly interface. It offers a unique blend of simplicity and power, with new features, particularly in tax-related functionalities and POS integration that other tools often treat as an afterthought.

Its noteworthy features, such as error detection and correction mechanisms, ensure that even users with minimal accounting knowledge can maintain accurate books and comply with tax laws. This positions TallyPrime as a compelling, cost-effective choice for business owners who value ease of use and reliability, fostering business growth.

### Customer Support

TallyPrime is supported by a network of partners and offers resources like documentation and tutorials. Response times can vary, and some users may find the decentralized support system less consistent than a centralized support team.

### Ease of Use

Navigating TallyPrime is straightforward, with a clean interface and logically organized menus. However, the depth of features means there can be a learning curve for new users, especially those not familiar with accounting principles.

### Integrations

TallyPrime offers several out-of-the-box integrations with banking and payment services. It also provides an API that developers can use to build custom integrations. Add-ons are available through Tally's extensive partner network, extending the platform's capabilities in areas like advanced analytics, customer relationship management, and more.
