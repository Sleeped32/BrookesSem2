### Improvement To Staff Productivity

Evidence and data. Interviewees said deploying Business Central allowed their organizations’ finance and operations staff to reduce the amount of time they spent on manual reporting and information reconciliation while also providing improved visibility and tools to accelerate and improve the quality of decision-making. Automating tasks within these finance and operations processes yielded quantifiable productivity savings for the organizations’ staff. As a result, as the organizations continued to grow, they required fewer finance and operations hires because of the capacity increase due to more efficient staff. Having a modern, intuitive user experience further improved productivity, which reduced the requirement for training or re-training for new and existing staff. Ultimately, migrating to Business Central in the cloud enabled finance and operations staff to operate more effectively while offsetting subsequent hires required as the organizations grew, which yielded savings quantified in user productivity.

- The interviewee at the manufacturing organization spoke to efficiencies for finance staff resulting from the Dynamics 365 Business Central migration — notably, integration with online document signatures, real-time reporting and integration with CRM, online customer payments, and faster internal reimbursements.
- A finance manager in the food and beverage importing industry said that after migrating to Dynamics 365 Business Central, their organization was able to consolidate several business units under one ERP system, which improved the productivity of supply-chain personnel by reducing the need to consolidate information across several business units operating on Microsoft Dynamics on-premises ERP solutions.
