**Survey:**

### Improvement To Staff Productivity

Evidence and data. Interviewees said deploying Business Central allowed their organizations’ finance and operations staff to reduce the amount of time they spent on manual reporting and information reconciliation while also providing improved visibility and tools to accelerate and improve the quality of decision-making. Automating tasks within these finance and operations processes yielded quantifiable productivity savings for the organizations’ staff. As a result, as the organizations continued to grow, they required fewer finance and operations hires because of the capacity increase due to more efficient staff. Having a modern, intuitive user experience further improved productivity, which reduced the requirement for training or re-training for new and existing staff. Ultimately, migrating to Business Central in the cloud enabled finance and operations staff to operate more effectively while offsetting subsequent hires required as the organizations grew, which yielded savings quantified in user productivity.

- The interviewee at the manufacturing organization spoke to efficiencies for finance staff resulting from the Dynamics 365 Business Central migration — notably, integration with online document signatures, real-time reporting and integration with CRM, online customer payments, and faster internal reimbursements.
- A finance manager in the food and beverage importing industry said that after migrating to Dynamics 365 Business Central, their organization was able to consolidate several business units under one ERP system, which improved the productivity of supply-chain personnel by reducing the need to consolidate information across several business units operating on Microsoft Dynamics on-premises ERP solutions.

Dynamics 365 Business Central can revolutionise how you do business, taking streamlining, automation and customer engagement to a new level. It gives you a single, end-to end solution for managing finances, operations, sales and customer service, and an opportunity to easily upgrade from entry-level accounting software and legacy [ERP systems](https://www.the365people.com/enterprise-resource-planning "ERP systems").

Dynamics 365 Business Central is great value because it integrates with other Microsoft cloud services including Office 365 and can be customised or extended for specific industry needs with Power Apps, Power Automate and Power BI.

### Pros

- **Integrated Solutions:** Dynamics 365 Business Central integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products like Outlook, Excel, and Teams, enhancing productivity by connecting various business functions.
- **Customization:** It offers extensive customization options through add-ons and Power Apps, allowing businesses to tailor the software to their unique needs.
- **User Experience:** The platform is known for its user-friendly interface, making it easier for team members to navigate and adapt, which improves overall efficiency.

### Cons

- **Complex Setup:** Setting up the software can be complex, especially for businesses without a dedicated IT team.
- **Cost for SMBS:** The pricing model can be challenging for smaller businesses, potentially affecting its affordability and accessibility.
- **Limited Scalability:** While effective for small to medium-sized businesses, it might not scale as efficiently for larger enterprises or those with more complex needs.

### Expert Opinion

Judging from its features, integrations, and user interface, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central stands out as a competent ERP solution. It excels in providing a comprehensive, user-friendly experience but can fall short in scalability and ease of initial setup. I find it most suitable for businesses that already rely on other Microsoft products and need a reliable ERP system to unify their operations.
