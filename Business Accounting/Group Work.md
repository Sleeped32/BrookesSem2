### Assessment Instructions - 

###### Deadline: 7th March 1pm


In Week 1 each group will be allocated 2 accounting systems to study. As a group, you should research these and prepare a group report about them (**1,000 words**, worth 20% of module marks). *The report should answer the following questions:* 

**• What accounting functions are supported by the systems you have researched?**
**• What type of organisations – and users – are they aimed at?**
**• What other systems (e.g., payroll) are the system designed to integrate with?**
**• What technology options are available in each case (e.g., hosted, shrink-wrapped)?**
**• What claims are made by the vendors about the quality of their systems?**
**• What is your view of the pros and cons of each system (imagine you were offering advice to a business owner or manager)?** 

The report should include an introduction, and provide examples and illustrations, such as screenshots (these are not part of the word count) where appropriate. Avoid being just ‘descriptive’ in your report: also, make use of use of material from the lectures and module texts (i.e., to conceptualise and analyse issues). You should also include a list of references (not included in the word count). Appendices are allowed but are not included in the word count and do not attract marks.
