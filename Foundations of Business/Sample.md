##### Introduction
This report will explore and consider the future potential of establishing a bicycle repair shop in Oxfordshire with their £20,000 in starting capital. Also, this report will show the implications of the external and industry environment. This will be done using PESTEL Analysis and Porter's Five Forces Analysis. 
##### PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL analysis identifies external factors that could influence business outcomes
- Main - Socio-cultural 
	- Consumer preferences leaning towards more green/ eco friendly option 
	- Choosing Bikes over cars
	- Especially in Oxford not great for cars
	- Consumers more health concession bike good exercise
- Political and Economic tensions are high all over the world at the moment .
	- The effect this would have on a bike repair shop would be negligible.
	- The shop wouldn't be exporting bikes to all over the world
	- Importing bikes could become more expensive 
-  Technological
	- Electric bikes are still unaffordable for most consumers
	- No new tech would replace bikes they have been around for a long time
-  legal
	-  The PBSR apply to those who sell new bikes, and ensure that new bicycles are safe when sold.
	- Not may important laws / regulations when it comes to running a bike store
- Environments
	- Doesn't really effect the demand for bikes 
	- Climate change could mean that more people would want to ride bikes if its warmer outside, effect would be negotiable at best
##### Porter's Five Forces Analysis
Porter's five forces model gives a framework to understand the completive forces within an industry. Also, the model evaluates the effect of the forces and how they can change the division of economic value among industries

The industry H&M are pursing is the cycling industry
	The threat of new entry is moderate due to the increase amount of riders thus an increase in demand for bikes leading to more firms entering the industry. There is also a moderate force due of rivalry with large retailers having a large amount of the industry. Even with the bigger companies like Amazon buying second hand from private sellers is still very populator 
	
	
	
	A larger force driving competition would be subsites. This is because of the increase cost of living leading to households have less disposable income and the high cost of bikes. There was a decrease in the sales volume for pedal cycles of 5% due to the higher costs it didn't lead to a decrease in revue for the industry 
##### Conclusion
Steal bikes so commsimers have to come back to buy another or otherwise they ae unable to get to work
