You are required to prepare a 600-word report on:

##### Introduction
This report will explore and consider the future potential of establishing a bicycle repair shop in Oxfordshire with their £20,000 in starting capital. Also, this report will show the implications of the external and industry environment. This will be done using PESTEL Analysis and Porter's Five Forces Analysis. 
##### PESTEL Analysis
Political and economic factors are important but the influence to business outcomes would be neglectable and uncontrollable. Legally the barriers to entry are low and would have a small if any influence on business outcomes. 
Technological development could help the business due to the popularity of e-bikes but due to the high costs the demand is still not as high as regulator pedal bikes. future development could lead to the price of e-bike decrease but there is still some time before than. Socio-cultural factors would have the most influence due to how we as a sociality are trying to be more eco friendly in how we live our life's. Sociality consumers are becoming more health concession which is why there is increasing amount of people riding bikes to work and for other things because it's a good forum of exercise

##### Porter's Five Forces Analysis
Porter's five forces model gives a framework to understand the completive forces within an industry. Also, the model evaluates the effect of the forces and how they can change the division of economic value among industries

The industry H&M are pursing is the cycling industry
	The threat of new entry is moderate due to the increase amount of riders thus an increase in demand for bikes leading to more firms entering the industry. It is unlikely that new entrants would be able compete with the established and larger firms. Also the market is predicated to keep growing which would ease rivalry in the market. 
	Threat of subaudition is high due to the high cost of living leading to households having less disponible income to spend on a luxury good like a bike. Even though there is an increase in interest in cycling from consumers it doesn't mean that they would have to able to spend a large amount of money on a bike. Consumer's optimism about the economic states of the country is lower than last year
	For H&M to counter this force they would focus on their repair side of the business since consumers would be more likely to want to repair their bike than buy a new one due to the high cost. Also they should make sure to sell affordable and used bikes since more people would be able  to afford it
	
##### Conclusion
This industry is a feasible option for new venture as there are gaps in the market for used bikes which consumers have shown to be interested in. The future of the industry is promising as well and interest rates are .  On the other hand if the economy doesn't improve it could be hard for them to be able to compete in a industry with established completion
