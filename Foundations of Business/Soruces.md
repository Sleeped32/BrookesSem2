- #### Now (2024): consolidation

We see 2024 as a year of consolidation, survival even, in the face of continued weak demand. While there are several bright spots in terms of individual segments performing well, demand continues to be affected by pressure on household finances.

#### Next (2025-26): modest recovery

With easing financial pressures, we expect modest volume growth in 2025, picking up pace in 2026. The rate of recovery depends on the industry's ability to counter negativity around e-bikes and the pace of change arising from increased government investment in walking, wheeling and cycling.

#### Future (2027-29): maintaining momentum

Long-term growth in participation will come from improvements in cycling infrastructure and attracting more people who don't see themselves as 'cyclists' but 'people who cycle'. A key way of doing this is through growing e-bike ownership, encouraging people to see them as an alternative to second cars.
