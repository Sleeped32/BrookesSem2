Harry and Mary will be setting up a Bicycle Sale & Repair shop. Their mission is to offer reliable eco conscious cycle services. With the vision to become the best place to go for expert advice and services that caters to a large amount of people. There are lots of different cycling stores in oxford with both Cycle King and Beeline on Cowley road. As well as Amazon which according to Mintel is the most popular retailer used to purchase bikes. The main challenge is going to be the cost-of-living crisis meaning that people don’t have as much money to spend on luxury goods. The increasing cycling trends are a good opportunity for the shop

The best strategy for the bike store would be a hybrid Strategy, this would allow the shop to reach the widest audience and thus get as many customers as possible. This strategy combines the best of both worlds, allowing them to offer premium products and services as well as affordable products. Due to the fact the affordable products would be around the premium products it would make even the more affordable products seem more premium.

Why not other strategy’s

Using a cost leadership strategy would be harder due to the fact it’s a small bike store and not a large corporation like amazon. Large corporations like amazon are able to offer products at lower prices because they have better relasnships with the manufactures which means that would be able to get more favorable prices compared to a small bike store.

Using a differentiation strategy would limit the amount of customers that would be willing to pay premium prices
